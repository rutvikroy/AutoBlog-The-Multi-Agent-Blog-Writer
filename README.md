# AutoBlog: The Multi-Agent Blog Writer

## Overview

AutoBlog is an innovative multi-agent system designed to automate the process of researching, writing, and editing blog posts. Built using the CrewAI framework and powered by Google's Gemini LLM, this project demonstrates how AI agents can collaborate to generate high-quality content on any given topic.

The system consists of three specialized AI agents:
- **Researcher Agent**: Gathers insights, trends, and data on the topic.
- **Reporting Agent**: Compiles the research into a structured blog draft.
- **Editor Agent**: Refines the draft for clarity, engagement, and SEO optimization.

This project is structured as a Python package with Jupyter notebooks for development stages, YAML configurations for agents and tasks, and a main script for execution. It's ideal for content creators, developers exploring AI automation, or businesses looking to streamline content generation.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Agents work sequentially to produce polished blog content.
- **Configurable via YAML**: Easily customize agent roles, goals, backstories, and task descriptions.
- **Gemini LLM Integration**: Uses Google's Gemini model for intelligent content generation.
- **Markdown Output**: Generates blog posts in clean Markdown format, ready for publishing.
- **Modular Structure**: Built with a clean project layout including configs, utils, pipelines, and notebooks.
- **Docker Support**: Includes a Dockerfile for easy containerization.

   ```
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Usage

### Running via Notebooks (Development Mode)

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open and run `notebooks/Stage_1_Agents_and_Tasks_Config_Ingest.ipynb` to load configurations.

3. Then run `notebooks/Stage_2_Create_Agents_and_Deploy_Crew.ipynb` to create agents, tasks, and kick off the crew. Provide a topic in the `crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "Your Topic Here"})` line.

   Example output: A Markdown-formatted blog post displayed in the notebook.

### Running via Main Script (Production Mode)

1. Update the topic in `main.py` (if applicable).

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   This will execute the full pipeline and generate a blog post.

### Customization

- Edit `config/agents.yaml` to modify agent details (e.g., role, goal).
- Edit `config/tasks.yaml` to adjust task descriptions and outputs.
- The system supports any topic; pass it via the `inputs` dictionary in the crew kickoff.

## Example Output

Running the crew with the topic "Beyond Chatbots: How AI Agents Orchestrate Complex Tasks" generates a Markdown blog post like this (excerpt):
